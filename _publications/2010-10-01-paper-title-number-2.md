excerpt: 'Social   housing   production   was   one   of   the   emblems of the Ecuadorian policy of the Citizen Revolution chaired  by  Rafael  Correa  for  10  years.  From  the  case  of  Ecuador,  it  is  analyzed  how progressive governments applied policies in the field of social housing and urban development. This article tracks the scales of application these social policies had regarding neoliberalism, from the  point  of  view  of  the  violence  and  responses  that  the  process  provoked.  In  Quito,  families  organized  to  obtain  the  promised  homes  after  years  of  waiting.  In  Guayaquil,  police  violence  displaced    entire    neighborhoods    to    achieve urban  renewal  through  an  ecological  plan.  In  Portoviejo,  from  the  earthquake  of  2016,  the  center was converted, and the houses were moved to the periphery. From an historic, spatial, and qualitative methodology, this analysis shows the limitations  of  the  proposals  of  the  progressive  governments,  and  the  popular  organization  to  avoid displacement towards the peripheries.'
